# GlobalShala Ad Campaign Analysis 

This project was completed as part of my internship at **Excelerate** as a **Data Analyst Trainee Intern** for GlobalShala. In collaboration with a team of five, we analyzed and visualized Facebook ad campaign data for the **Superhero U (SHU)** event. The objective was to evaluate campaign performance, identify underperforming ads, provide cost-saving recommendations, and support the Finance team in optimizing marketing spend. The analysis leveraged Python-based data exploration and visualization, combined with clear reporting and presentation, to guide data-driven marketing decisions.

## Tools Used
- **Python** – Data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).  
- **PowerPoint** – Presented findings, recommendations, and optimization strategies to stakeholders.

## Insights Generated

### 1. Total Clicks by Ad Campaign
- Lowest clicks observed in SHU campaigns in **Australia, Canada, UK, and USA**, indicating low audience interaction.

### 2. Total Views (Reach & Impressions)
- Canada, USA, Australia, and UK campaigns reached fewer people, limiting visibility.

### 3. Average Frequency by Ad Campaign
- Australia, UK, USA, and India campaigns had low frequency, reducing audience recall and engagement.

### 4. Cost Per Result (CPR) & Cost Per Click (CPC)
- Australia, UK, UAE, and Canada were the most expensive campaigns with high CPR and CPC.

### 5. Unique Link Clicks (ULC) vs Amount Spent
- Scatter plot highlights cost-effective campaigns in **green**, underperforming campaigns in **orange**, and campaigns needing optimization in **gray**.

### 6. CTR & Unique CTR
- Underperforming campaigns: Australia (Campaign 3), UK (Campaign 10), Educators & Principals (Campaign 1), UAE (Campaign 9).

### 7. CPC by Geography & Age
- Poor cost efficiency observed in older age groups in Australia and the UK, indicating higher costs with lower returns.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, three campaigns repeatedly showed low engagement and high costs:  

1. **SHU (Australia)** – Highest CPR, very low ULC and CTR; recommend discontinuation.  
2. **SHU (UK)** – Extremely low engagement with high CPR; recommend optimization.  
3. **SHU (UAE)** – Moderate spending but poor returns; recommend optimization.  

**Optimization Strategies for UK & UAE:**  
- **Refine Audience Targeting** – Reach the most relevant audience segments.  
- **Enhance Ad Visuals** – Use engaging images, videos, or testimonials.  
- **Test Varied Formats** – Explore video, carousel, or interactive ads.  
- **Adjust Frequency** – Avoid ad fatigue by limiting exposure.

## Conclusion
Discontinuing the Australia campaign will cut costs with minimal impact, while optimizing UK and UAE campaigns can improve engagement and ROI. This analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide marketing budget decisions effectively.
